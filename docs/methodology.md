# Methodology

Systematic review of other people's studies. Essentially, I think I should use my captain's log, and research guides to describe how I gathered this information and what I looked for in sources that I would trust. **I think this will be a lot of work to be honest because I am going to have to audit all of the sources I used.** I know I have seen this done in some studies I have read, so I should consult those on how to really do this.

- Discuss what made sources I trust 
- Discuss search terms used and where
    - Databases, sources, and why I searched these things
- Begin discussing why I had trouble finding large amounts of research
