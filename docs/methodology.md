# Methodology

### Exploration
I spent one month, from 9-7-2023 to 10-6-2023, researching the broader field of computers/technology in medicine. This was an investigative and inquiry based research venture. I researched this topic through 9 lenses: individual, interpersonal, human differences, organizational, policy, ethics, historical, cultural, and multi-disciplinary in an attempt to begin understanding this complex and technical field of biomedical engineering, software engineering, and health/medicine from a primarily social and human point of view. Additionally, this was completed to familiarize myself with industry terms, standards, and practices, while honing in on research topics I was most interested in. I used very minimal sources from this breadth style research, but an exhaustive list of search terms can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oNA6XXVFzFoIJnYeAsb0xS4jXLMmwv-RUrTuOrg_6s0/edit?usp=sharing).

### Critical Decision in Methodology
After completing a breadth of research, and realizing what I was interested in, I decided to focus on Robotically assisted surgical devices (RASDs) and robotically assisted surgeries. More specifically, I decided to analysis the difference in outcomes in robotically assisted surgeries, laparoscopic surgeries, and open surgeries.

### Investigation
Using my exploration sources as a jumping block, I then spent just under one month, from 10-9-2023 to 11-3-2023, specifically researching RASDs, and the measurements of surgical outcomes they generate when compared to surgeries completed laparoscopically and open. I systematically inspected studies I found through strategic search terms in various databases. A comprehensive list of search terms can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-QmiSYuMmubs0tnvtkqNF4EqeaW7_pREKFZtQRO3Y6c/edit?usp=sharing), and a full bibliography from this research can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oNA6XXVFzFoIJnYeAsb0xS4jXLMmwv-RUrTuOrg_6s0/edit?usp=sharing).

More recently, I conducted a systematic review through the University of Colorado's academic [database](https://www.colorado.edu/libraries/research/find-articles-and-databases). I searched my University's edition of [ProQuest](https://about.proquest.com/) and [EbscoHost](https://www.ebsco.com/products/ebscohost-research-platform) (Academic Search Premier).  

The search queries used in these two databases were:
- Robotic Assisted Surgery
- Robotic Assisted Surgery vs. Laparoscopic
- Robotic Assisted Surgery vs. Open
- Outcomes in Robotic Surgeries

Note: There was a significant amount of overlap in studies returned from the two databases.

Studies were chosen based on their relevance, in terms of direct comparisons between robotic surgeries and their laparoscopic and/or open counterparts. Studies were selected from peer-reviewed journals, and were used to compare specific surgical practices that would hopefully lead to an evidence-based, general conclusion. Furthermore, studies were selected based on the statistical significance of their findings. The outcomes of interest originally were mortality, complications, cost, length of stay, and long term survival; however, further outcomes (operative time) were extracted based on results in studies that were analyzed.
