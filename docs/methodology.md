# Methodology

### Exploration 
I spent one month, from 9-7-2023 to 10-6-2023, researching the broader field of computers/technology in medicine. This was an investigative and inquiry based research venture. I researched this topic through 9 lenses: individual, interpersonal, human differences, organizational, policy, ethics, historical, cultural, and multi-disciplinary in an attempt to begin understanding this complex and technical field of biomedical engineering, software engineering, and health/medicine from a primarly social and human point of view. Additionally, this was completed to familiarize myself with industry terms, standards, and practices, while honing in on research topics I was most interested in. I used very minimal sources from this breadth style research, but an exhaustive list of search terms can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oNA6XXVFzFoIJnYeAsb0xS4jXLMmwv-RUrTuOrg_6s0/edit?usp=sharing) and a full bibliography can be found [here](link).

### Critical Decision in Methodology
After completing a breadth of research, and realizing what I was interested in, I decided to focus on Robotically assisted surgical devices (RASDs) and robotically assisted surgeries. More specifically, I decided to analysis the difference in outcomes in robotically assisted surgeries, laparoscopic surgeries, and open surgeries. 

### Investigation 
- Include another full list of search terms and bibliography
- Include information about conducting outreach
