# Abstract

#### Research questions:
	- Why is there a lack of conclusive research regarding the outcomes of Robot Assisted Surgeries (RAS)?
	- What **does** the current data indicate in terms of patient safety?

#### Objectives:
This is Systematic review of outcomes of RAS when compared to traditional laparoscopic and open surgeries and an analysis of why much of the current data is considered inconclusive.

#### Topics:
Medicine and health, technology adoption, Internet and technology

#### Methodology:
Systematic search across various engines and databases focused on:
	- Robotic Assisted Surgery
	- Robotic Assisted Surgery vs. Laparoscopic
	- Robotic Assisted Surgery vs. Open
	- Outcomes in Robotic Surgeries

#### Results:
A large portion of data suggests RAS is a viable, if not better, option in many contexts .

#### Conclusions:
More conclusive research is needed to understand the complete viability of RAS in many contexts and use cases.

#### Keywords: *Robotic surgery*, *Robotically assisted surgical devices*, *medical technology*
