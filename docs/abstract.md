# Abstract

- Systematic review of outcomes of robotic vs. laraposcopic vs. open surgery
- Analysis of why there is limited conclusive data available to the public 
- Topics: Medicine and health, technology adoption, Internet and technology [cite](https://www.pewresearch.org/topics/)
- Research questions:
    - Why is their a lack of research regarding the outcomes of RAS
    - What **does** the current data indicate in terms of patient safety?
    - How does innovation still thrive despite this pubically available information?
- Methods: Break down captain's log searches (I guess this was important after all)
- Results: Limited data shows success in certain non-cancerous use cases
- Conclusions: Need more publically available research 
- Keywords: *Robotic surgery*, *Robotically assisted surgical devices*, *medical technology*
