# Discussion

From the results of the systematic review, it is apparent further testing is important to determine the effectiveness and safety of RASDs. A majority of studies included in their results, discussion, or conclusion that further testing was imperative to understand the pros and cons of Robotically Assisted Surgical devices. This was mostly due to a large number of retrospective studies that limit statistical viability and ability to make a conclusive assertion. Randomized control trials with **much** larger sample sizes must be conducted to further understand the viability of RAS in different contexts. Furthermore, a heavy emphasis on error reporting, and accountability is important.

It is clear innovation still thrives in this industry, and RASDs are undoubtedly the future of surgery, but conclusive evidence is still required. One day autonomous RASDs, like the Smart Tissue Autonomous Robot (STAR), developed by a team lead by Axel Krieger, Ph.D, at John Hopkins that can perform aspects of bowel surgery with extremely limited human assistance may be the one performing surgery on all of us [^2].
