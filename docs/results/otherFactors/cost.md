# Cost

For the most part, it is agreed that RAS costs the patient more money, when compared to Laparoscopic surgeries. In a systematic review of the 40 most cited articles comparing RAS and Video Assisted Surgery (VAR), 16 studies mentioning operation costs, 87.5% determined RAS cost more than VAR [^1].

As shown in the figure below, often the increased time of operation is the largest contributing factor the the overall increased cost of RAS.

Furthermore, the additional large upfront cost of the robot itself can add additional costs that are passed onto the patient [^4]. Still, there is some disagreement between scholars about the cost comparison when taking into account what type of surgeries are completed with RAS, and the context surrounding the entire hospital or surgery center stay. Some studies show that the decreased rates of complications and length of stay when compared to more traditional surgeries, RAS can be a financially competitive option for patients [^5].
