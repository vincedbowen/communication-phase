# Operation Time

It is a consistent finding among scholarly articles that RAS takes longer time in the operating room than laparoscopic or open surgery. In a systematic review of the 40 most cited articles comparing RAS and Video Assisted Surgery (VAR), 52% of studies mentioning operative times found longer operative times in RAS [^1].
