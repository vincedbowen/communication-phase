# Rates of Complications

Overall, the majority of studies find rates of complications are lower in Robotic Assisted Surgeries when compared to their laparoscopic and open counterparts.

Furthermore, there are lower transfusion rates and higher rates of trifecta, a term referring to the achievement of negative surgical margins, an ischemia time less than 25 minutes, and no postoperative complications (12). It is generally a consensus that intra-operation and postoperative complications are lower in RAS. As Corrado notes, "Minimally invasive surgery was superior to abdominal surgery in terms of surgical outcomes. Robotic surgery was superior to laparoscopy in terms of intra- and post-operative complications'' [^2]

## Intraoperative Bleeding
An important and common risk during surgery is intraoperative bleeding, but often RAS can lower the amount of estimated blood loss among patients.
This also drastically lowers the rate of transfusions in patients. In a systematic review of the 40 most cited articles comparing RAS and Video Assisted Surgery (VAR), 60% of the studies mentioning intraoperative bleeding found lower estimated blood loss amounts in RAS. Multiple other studies in this systematic review also found lower blood loss in RAS [^4] [^5] [^6] [^7] [^8] [^9] [^10].
