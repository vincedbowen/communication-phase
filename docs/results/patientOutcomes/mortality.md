# Mortality

Many studies find lower rates of mortality in RAS, likely due to the lower overall amounts of intraoperative and postoperative complications. In a study comparing cancerous, oral Open surgeries and Robotic Assisted surgeries in a Tiawanese hospital, lower mortality rates where found regardless of the presence of cancer [^1].

In a retrospective study, analyzing patient outcomes from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), a 20% stratified sample of hospital discharge information in the United States, found lower mortality rates in RAS [^3].
