# Long Term Survival

Long term survival is one of the most widely debated aspect of surgical outcomes with RAS. In 2021, the FDA issued a warning, “There is little evidence on the safety and effectiveness of the use of RAS devices in patients undergoing mastectomy for the prevention or treatment of breast cancer, and the FDA has not granted any RAS device marketing authorization for mastectomy”, reiterating the lack of evidence in "cancer-related outcomes such as overall survival, recurrence, and disease-free survival" [^1]. Numerous Studies find lower **long term** survival rates when comparing RAS to open or laparoscopic surgeries.

The FDA also noted that a large number of studies have found **no** difference in the long term survival rates between surgical techniques [^3].
