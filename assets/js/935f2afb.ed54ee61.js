A majority of studies included in their results, discussion, or conclusion that further testing was imperative to understand the pros and cons of Robotically Assisted Surgical devices. This was mostly due to a large number of retrospective studies that limit statistical viability and ability to make a conclusive assertion. Randomized control trials with much larger sample sizes must be conducted to further understand the viability of RAS in different contexts. Furthermore, a heavy emphasis on error reporting, and accountability is important.","sidebar":"sidebar"},"introduction":{"id":"introduction","title":"Introduction","description":"Robotic Assisted Surgery (RAS) is a type of surgery, employing the use of mechanical arms, cameras, and software systems in an attempt to increase the control, precision, and field of view of surgeons . Often, Robotic Assisted Surgical Devices (RASDs) are the only option if a surgeon wishes to perform minimally invasive, laparoscopic surgery . Other times, open surgery, traditional laparoscopic surgery, and RAS may be options. Patients, healthcare providers, and regulatory agencies such as the FDA must make informed decisions on the outcomes of these devices. Surgical outcomes are often incredibly hard to measure, and successes can widely vary . Regardless, various metrics can be standardized and allow the comparison of surgical practices and techniques. The outcomes measured in this review focus on patient safety, the overall cost perspective, and usage rates among surgeons.","sidebar":"sidebar"},"methodology":{"id":"methodology","title":"Methodology","description":"Exploration","sidebar":"sidebar"},"results/otherFactors/cost":{"id":"results/otherFactors/cost","title":"Cost","description":"For the most part, it is agreed that RAS costs the patient more money, when compared to Laparoscopic surgeries. In a systematic review of the 40 most cited articles comparing RAS and Video Assisted Surgery (VAR), 16 studies mentioning operation costs, 87.5% determined RAS cost more than VAR .","sidebar":"sidebar"},"results/otherFactors/operationTime":{"id":"results/otherFactors/operationTime","title":"Operation Time","description":"It is a consistent finding among scholarly articles that RAS takes longer time in the operating room than laparoscopic or open surgery. In a systematic review of the 40 most cited articles comparing RAS and Video Assisted Surgery (VAR), 52% of studies mentioning operative times found longer operative times in RAS .","sidebar":"sidebar"},"results/otherFactors/usageTrends":{"id":"results/otherFactors/usageTrends","title":"Usage Trends","description":"Usage trends are continously rising among physicians, as more surgeons choose to use RASDs. Furthermore, more patients are opting to have physicians utilize RASDs to complete there surgeries. On December 14, 2021, \u201c\u2026 the number of robotic-assisted surgical procedures performed worldwide by surgeons using da Vinci surgical systems\u2026 surpassed 10 million\u201d .","sidebar":"sidebar"},"results/patientOutcomes/lengthOfStay":{"id":"results/patientOutcomes/lengthOfStay","title":"Length of Stay","description":"Lower lengths of Stays when performing Robotically Assisted surgeries are a fairly consistent finding among studies. This is likely due to the lower rates of intra and post-operative complications, less conversions to open-surgery, and smaller incisions.","sidebar":"sidebar"},"results/patientOutcomes/longTermSurvive":{"id":"results/patientOutcomes/longTermSurvive","title":"Long Term Survival","description":"Long term survival is one of the most widely debated aspect of surgical outcomes with RAS. In 2021, the FDA issued a warning, \u201cThere is little evidence on the safety and effectiveness of the use of RAS devices in patients undergoing mastectomy for the prevention or treatment of breast cancer, and the FDA has not granted any RAS device marketing authorization for mastectomy\u201d, reiterating the lack of evidence in \\"cancer-related outcomes such as overall survival, recurrence, and disease-free survival\\" . Numerous Studies find lower long term survival rates when comparing RAS to open or laparoscopic surgeries.","sidebar":"sidebar"},"results/patientOutcomes/mortality":{"id":"results/patientOutcomes/mortality","title":"Mortality","description":"Many studies find lower rates of mortality in RAS, likely due to the lower overall amounts of intraoperative and postoperative complications. In a study comparing cancerous, oral Open surgeries and Robotic Assisted surgeries in a Tiawanese hospital, lower mortality rates where found regardless of the presence of cancer .","sidebar":"sidebar"},"results/patientOutcomes/rateOfComplication":{"id":"results/patientOutcomes/rateOfComplication","title":"Rates of Complications","description":"Overall, the majority of studies find rates of complications are lower in Robotic Assisted Surgeries when compared to their laparoscopic and open counterparts.","sidebar":"sidebar"}}}')}}]);
