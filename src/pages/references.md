- abstract: Background Use of robotic systems for minimally invasive
    surgery has rapidly increased during the last decade. Understanding
    the causes of adverse events and their impact on patients in
    robot-assisted surgery will help improve systems and operational
    practices to avoid incidents in the future. Methods By developing an
    automated natural language processing tool, we performed a
    comprehensive analysis of the adverse events reported to the
    publicly available MAUDE database (maintained by the U.S. Food and
    Drug Administration) from 2000 to 2013. We determined the number of
    events reported per procedure and per surgical specialty, the most
    common types of device malfunctions and their impact on patients,
    and the potential causes for catastrophic events such as patient
    injuries and deaths. Results During the study period, 144 deaths
    (1.4% of the 10,624 reports), 1,391 patient injuries (13.1%), and
    8,061 device malfunctions (75.9%) were reported. The numbers of
    injury and death events per procedure have stayed relatively
    constant (mean = 83.4, 95% confidence interval (CI), 74.2--92.7 per
    100,000 procedures) over the years. Surgical specialties for which
    robots are extensively used, such as gynecology and urology, had
    lower numbers of injuries, deaths, and conversions per procedure
    than more complex surgeries, such as cardiothoracic and head and
    neck (106.3 vs. 232.9 per 100,000 procedures, Risk Ratio = 2.2, 95%
    CI, 1.9--2.6). Device and instrument malfunctions, such as falling
    of burnt/broken pieces of instruments into the patient (14.7%),
    electrical arcing of instruments (10.5%), unintended operation of
    instruments (8.6%), system errors (5%), and video/imaging problems
    (2.6%), constituted a major part of the reports. Device malfunctions
    impacted patients in terms of injuries or procedure interruptions.
    In 1,104 (10.4%) of all the events, the procedure was interrupted to
    restart the system (3.1%), to convert the procedure to non-robotic
    techniques (7.3%), or to reschedule it (2.5%). Conclusions Despite
    widespread adoption of robotic systems for minimally invasive
    surgery in the U.S., a non-negligible number of technical
    difficulties and complications are still being experienced during
    procedures. Adoption of advanced techniques in design and operation
    of robotic surgical systems and enhanced mechanisms for adverse
    event reporting may reduce these preventable incidents in the
    future.

- abstract: "Objective To compare different techniques of minimally
    invasive surgery (laparoscopy and robotics) to abdominal surgery in
    order to identify the optimal surgical technique in the treatment of
    endometrial cancer. Methods and materials A single-institutional,
    matched, retrospective, cohort study was performed. All patients
    with clinical stage I or occult stage II endometrial cancer who
    underwent robotic hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy Â±
    lymphadenectomy from August 2010 and December 2013 were identified.
    Surgical and oncological outcomes were compared with patients
    matched by age, body mass index, tumor histology, and grade, who
    underwent abdominal or laparoscopic surgery between January 2001 and
    December 2013. Results Three groups were identified: 177
    laparotomies (group A), 277 laparoscopies (group B) and 72 robotics
    (group C). There were no statistically significant differences
    between the three groups in terms of age, BMI and FIGO stage. The
    operative time was shortest in group B (p = 0.0001). Blood loss and
    transfusions were equivalent in group B and C, while they were
    greater in group A (p = 0.0001). The intra-operative, early and late
    postoperative complications, rate of conversion, the re-intervention
    and median hospital stay were lower in group C. The rate of
    recurrence and death from disease was similar in all three groups.
    Conclusions Minimally invasive surgery was superior to abdominal
    surgery in terms of surgical outcomes. Robotic surgery was superior
    to laparoscopy in terms of intra- and post-operative complications,
    conversion rates, length of hospital stay and re-interventions. In
    terms of oncological outcomes the three groups were equivalent."

- abstract: "Objective To compare outcomes between robotic versus
    laparoscopic hysterectomy and lymphadenectomy in patients with
    endometrial cancer. Methods A cohort study was performed by
    prospectively identifying all patients with clinical stage I or
    occult stage II endometrial cancer who underwent robotic
    hysterectomy and lymphadenectomy from 2006--2008 and retrospectively
    comparing data using the same surgeons' laparoscopic hysterectomy
    and lymphadenectomy cases from 1998--2005, prior to our robotic
    experience. Patient demographics, operative times, complications,
    conversion rates, pathologic results, and length of stay were
    analyzed. Results 181 patients (105 robotic and 76 laparoscopic) met
    inclusion criteria. There was no significant difference between the
    two groups in median age, uterine weight, bilateral pelvic or aortic
    lymph node counts, or complication rates in patients whose surgeries
    were completed minimally invasively. Despite a higher BMI (34 vs.
    29, P\\\\textless0.001), the estimated blood loss (100 vs. 250 mL,
    P\\\\textless0.001), transfusion rate (3% vs. 18%, RR 0.18, 95%CI
    0.05--0.64, P=0.002), laparotomy conversion rate (12% vs. 26%, RR
    0.47, 95%CI 0.25--0.89, P=0.017), and length of stay (median: 1 vs.
    2 nights, P\\\\textless0.001) were lower in the robotic patients
    compared to the laparoscopic cohort. The odds ratio of conversion to
    laparotomy based on BMI for robotics compared to laparoscopy is 0.20
    (95% CI 0.08--0.56, P=0.002). The mean skin to skin time (242 vs.
    287 min, P\\\\textless0.001) and total room time (305 vs. 336 min,
    P\\\\textless0.001) was shorter for the robotic cohort. Conclusion
    Robotic hysterectomy and lymphadenectomy for endometrial carcinoma
    can be accomplished in heavier patients and results in shorter
    operating times and hospital length of stay, a lower transfusion
    rate, and less frequent conversion to laparotomy when compared to
    laparoscopic hysterectomy and lymphadenectomy."

  volume: 3
- abstract: Robot-assisted surgeries allows the surgeons to operate
    using remote-controlled robotic arms that are more effective in
    comparison to conventional (open/laparoscopic) surgeries. However,
    there is substantial lack of evidence on the effectiveness of
    robot-assisted surgeries in low to middle income countries (LMICs)
    like India. A study was conducted with an aim to evaluate the
    average length of stay (ALOS), Operative time, economic status
    (patient's) and cost borne by the patient (patient's expenditure)
    for undergoing robot-assisted surgeries and conventional surgeries.
    Grouping of the surgical procedures was done wherein patients who
    were treated with robot-assisted surgical procedures were placed in
    Group-01 whereas those treated with conventional surgical procedures
    were placed under Group-02. Comparative evaluation of the two
    surgical groups revealed that in robot-assisted surgical procedure,
    the ALOS was less (18.43 vs. 23.14 days, p = 0.06) whereas operative
    time (316.7 vs. 252.63 min, p = 0.05) and patient's expenditure were
    more (INR 70,654.29 vs. INR 41,314.73, p = 0.00). However, there was
    no significant difference between the economic statuses of patients
    in both groups. The study concluded that in this era of rapidly
    expanding health care scenario; targeted, regular, rigorous and
    repeated training programmes in future may shorten the learning
    curve thereby paving a way to reduce the cost as well as the
    operative time of robot-assisted surgeries in LMICs.

- abstract: Use of robotic surgery has increased in urological practice
    over the last decade. However, the use, outcomes, and costs of
    robotic nephrectomy are unknown.To examine the trend in use of
    robotic-assisted operations for radical nephrectomy in the United
    States and to compare the perioperative outcomes and costs with
    laparoscopic radical nephrectomy.This retrospective cohort study
    used the Premier Healthcare database to evaluate outcomes of
    patients who had undergone robotic-assisted or laparoscopic radical
    nephrectomy for renal mass at 416 US hospitals between January 2003
    and September 2015. Multivariable regression modeling was used to
    assess outcomes.Robotic-assisted vs laparoscopic radical
    nephrectomy.The primary outcome of the study was the trend in use of
    robotic-assisted radical nephrectomy. The secondary outcomes were
    perioperative complications, based on the Clavien classification
    system, and defined as any complication (Clavien grades 1-5) or
    major complications (Clavien grades 3-5, for which grade 5 results
    in death); resource use (operating time, blood transfusion, length
    of hospital stay); and direct hospital cost.Among 23 753 patients
    included in the study (mean age, 61.4 years; men, 13 792 \[58.1%\]),
    18 573 underwent laparoscopic radical nephrectomy and 5180 underwent
    robotic-assisted radical nephrectomy. Use of robotic-assisted
    surgery increased from 1.5% (39 of 2676 radical nephrectomy
    procedures in 2003) to 27.0% (862 of 3194 radical nephrectomy
    procedures) in 2015 (P for trend &lt;.001). In the weighted-adjusted
    analysis, there were no significant differences between
    robotic-assisted and laparoscopic radical nephrectomy in the
    incidence of any (Clavien grades 1-5) postoperative complications
    (adjusted rates, 22.2% vs 23.4%, difference, â1.2%; 95% CI, â5.4 to
    3.0%) or major (Clavien grades 3-5) complications (adjusted rates,
    3.5% vs 3.8%, difference, â0.3%; 95% CI, â1.0% to 0.5%). The rate of
    prolonged operating time (&gt;4 hours) for patients undergoing the
    robotic-assisted procedure was higher than for patients receiving
    the laparoscopic procedure in the adjusted analysis (46.3% vs 25.8%;
    risk difference, 20.5%; 95% CI, 14.2% to 26.8%). Robotic-assisted
    radical nephrectomy was associated with higher mean 90-day direct
    hospital costs (\\19 530 vs \\16 851; difference, \\2678; 95% CI,
    \\838 to \\4519), mainly accounted for operating room (\\7217 vs
    \\5378; difference, \\1839; 95% CI, \\1050 to \\2628) and supply
    costs (\\4876 vs \\3891; difference, \\985; 95% CI, \\473 to
    \$1498).Among patients undergoing radical nephrectomy for renal mass
    between 2003 and 2015, the use of robotic-assisted surgery increased
    substantially. The use of robotic-assistance was not associated with
    increased risk of any or major complications but was associated with
    prolonged operating time and higher hospital costs compared with
    laparoscopic surgery.

- abstract: Over the last 2 decades, laparoscopic surgical procedures
    have been developed for a variety of operations. Laparoscopic
    surgery allows for the completion of a procedure through multiple
    small incisions as opposed to laparotomy, which requires 1 large
    incision. For many procedures, laparoscopy has been demonstrated to
    be safe and is associated with fewer complications, shorter
    hospitalization, and faster return to normal function than
    laparotomy.More recently, robotic-assisted surgery has emerged as an
    alternative minimally invasive surgical option. In essence,
    laparoscopic instrumentation is connected to a robotic device that
    is controlled by a surgeon seated at a remote console.
    Robotic-assisted technology allows for 3-dimensional visualization,
    enhanced range of motion of the instrumentation, and improved
    surgeon ergonomics. Robotically assisted surgery first gained
    prominence for performance of radical prostatectomy, a procedure in
    which laparoscopic surgery was rarely performed. Since the use of
    the surgical robot for prostatectomy, the technology has been
    studied and promoted for a variety of other procedures.

- abstract: "IMPORTANCE: As robotic-assisted cardiac surgical procedures
    increase nationwide, surgeons need to be educated on the safety of
    the new modality compared with that of open technique. OBJECTIVE: To
    compare complications, length of stay (LOS), actual cost, and
    mortality between nonrobotic and robotic-assisted cardiac surgical
    procedures. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Weighted data on
    cardiac patients who had undergone operations involving the valves
    or septa and vessels, as well as other heart and pericardium
    procedures, from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2011, were
    obtained from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample via the Healthcare
    Cost and Utilization Project of the Agency for Healthcare Research
    and Quality. Propensity score matching was used to match each
    robotic-assisted case to 2 nonrobotic cases on 14 characteristics.
    MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Complications, median LOS, actual cost,
    and mortality. RESULTS: Exploratory analysis found a total of
    1,374,653 cardiac cases (1,369,454 \\[99.6%\\] nonrobotic and 5199
    \\[0.4%\\] robotic-assisted cases). After propensity score matching,
    there were 10,331 (66.5%) nonrobotic cases and 5199 (33.5%)
    robotic-assisted cases. Cardiac operations included 1630 (10.5%)
    involving the valves or septa, 6616 (42.6%) involving the vessels,
    and 7284 (46.9%) other heart and pericardium procedures.
    Robotic-assisted compared with nonrobotic surgery had a higher
    median cost (\\\\39,030 vs \\\\36,340; P \\\\textless .001) but lower LOS
    (5 vs 6 days; P \\\\textless .001) and lower mortality (1.0% vs 1.9%;
    P \\\\textless .001). Robotic-assisted surgery had significantly fewer
    complications for all operation types (30.3% vs 27.2%; P \\\\textless
    .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Overall, robotic-assisted surgery
    has significantly reduced median LOS, complications, and mortality
    compared with nonrobotic surgery. Results of this study support the
    contention that robotic-assisted surgery is as safe as nonrobotic
    surgery and offers the surgeon an additional technique for
    performing cardiac surgery."

    interventions using the same transperitoneal anterograde technique.
    Outcome measurements and statistical analysis Continence, potency,
    and serum prostate-specific antigen were assessed postoperatively at
    1, 3, 6, and 12 mo, and then every 6 mo until 60 mo. At the end of
    the follow-up period, patients were administered questions 1 and 46
    of the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite questionnaire to
    assess their satisfaction with the intervention and general health
    status. A generalised estimating equations model was used to compare
    time series data for functional results, and Kaplan-Meier and Cox
    models were used to analyse oncologic outcomes. Results and
    limitations The probability of achieving continence (odds ratio
    \[OR\] 2.47, pâ\<â0.021) and potency (OR 2.35, pâ\<â0.028) over time
    was more than doubled for the RARP compared to the LRP group. There
    was no difference between the two approaches in terms of patient
    survival. Pathologic Gleason score, positive surgical margins, and
    pT stage were associated with significantly higher biochemical
    recurrence in Cox multivariate models. Patient satisfaction with the
    intervention and their general health status was significantly
    higher in the RARP group. Conclusions Throughout the 5-yr follow-up,
    RARP yielded better functional results compared to LRP, without
    compromising oncologic outcomes. Patient summary In this report we
    looked at 5-yr outcomes for a study comparing robot-assisted radical
    prostatectomy (RARP) and laparascopic radical prostatectomy for the
    treatment of prostate cancer. We found that continence and potency
    are better among patients treated with RARP, while oncologic results
    are comparable.

- abstract: "Since its introduction in 1997, robotic surgery has
    overcome many limitations, including setup costs and surgeon
    training. The use of robotics in general surgery remains unknown.
    This study evaluates robotic-assisted procedures in general surgery
    by comparing characteristics with its nonrobotic (laparoscopic and
    open) counterparts. Weighted Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project
    Nationwide Inpatient Sample data (2008, 2009) were used to identify
    the top 12 procedures for robotic general surgery. Robotic cases
    were identified by Current Procedural Terminology codes 17.41 and
    17.42. Procedures were grouped: esophagogastric, colorectal,
    adrenalectomy, lysis of adhesion, and cholecystectomy. Analyses were
    descriptive, t tests, Ï(2)s, and logistic regression. Charges and
    length of stay were adjusted for gender, age, race, payer, hospital
    bed size, hospital location, hospital region, median household
    income, Charlson score, and procedure type. There were 1,389,235
    (97.4%) nonrobotic and 37,270 (2.6%) robotic cases. Robotic cases
    increased from 0.8 per cent (2008) to 4.3 per cent (2009, P
    \\\\textless 0.001). In all subgroups, robotic surgery had
    significantly shorter lengths of stay (4.9 days) than open surgery
    (6.1 days) and lower charges (median \\\\30,540) than laparoscopic
    (\\\\34,537) and open (\\$46,704) surgery. Fewer complications were
    seen in robotic-assisted colorectal, adrenalectomy and lysis of
    adhesion; however, robotic cholecystectomy and esophagogastric
    procedures had higher complications than nonrobotic surgery (P
    \\\\textless 0.05). Overall robotic surgery had a lower mortality rate
    (0.097%) than nonrobotic surgeries per 10,000 procedures
    (laparoscopic 0.48%, open 0.92%; P \\\\textless 0.001). The cost of
    robotic surgery is generally considered a prohibitive factor. In the
    present study, when overall cost was considered, including length of
    stay, robotic surgery appeared to be cost-effective and as safe as
    nonrobotic surgery except in cholecystectomy and esophagogastric
    procedures. Further study is needed to fully understand the
    long-term implications of this new technology."

- abstract: "Background and Objectives: We sought to provide informed
    recommendations on transitioning from laparoscopic radical
    prostatectomy (LRP) to robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RAP)
    through a study of the da Vinci robot. Methods: We performed a
    cost-benefit analysis to determine the impact that purchasing a
    \\\\1.5 million da Vinci robot with a \\\\112,000 service contract per
    year and \\$200 per case of disposables would have on profits of a
    mature laparoscopic prostatectomy program. Results: Seventy-eight
    cases per year are needed to cover the costs of a purchased robot,
    while only 20 cases per year are needed if a robot is donated. Once
    robot costs are covered, increases in caseload lead to increased
    income. Profit is not feasible at centers performing fewer than 25
    cases annually. A donated robot lessens costs and allows reasonable
    revenue without drastic increases in caseload. Conclusions: Our data
    suggest a high-volume LRP program can convert to RAP and maintain
    profits; however, the cost of the robot precludes equal income as
    that with LRP. Purchasing a robot is not fiscally viable in a
    low-volume program. Given comparable outcomes between LRP and RAP,
    hospitals need to decide whether market forces or the intangible
    benefits of robotics outweigh the expenses of obtaining and
    operating a robot."

- abstract: Software is vital for the advancement of biology and
    medicine. Analysis of usage and impact metrics can help developers
    determine user and community engagement, justify additional funding,
    encourage additional use, identify unanticipated use cases, and help
    define improvement areas. However, there are challenges associated
    with these analyses including distorted or misleading metrics, as
    well as ethical and security concerns. More attention to the nuances
    involved in capturing impact across the spectrum of biological
    software is needed. Furthermore, some tools may be especially
    beneficial to a small audience, yet may not have compelling typical
    usage metrics. We propose more general guidelines, as well as
    strategies for more specific types of software. We highlight
    outstanding issues regarding how communities measure or evaluate
    software impact. To get a deeper understanding of current practices
    for software evaluations, we performed a survey of participants in
    the Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR) program funded
    by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). We also investigated
    software among this community and others to assess how often
    infrastructure that supports such evaluations is implemented and how
    this impacts rates of papers describing usage of the software. We
    find that developers recognize the utility of analyzing software
    usage, but struggle to find the time or funding for such analyses.
    We also find that infrastructure such as social media presence, more
    in-depth documentation, the presence of software health metrics, and
    clear information on how to contact developers seem to be associated
    with increased usage rates. Our findings can help scientific
    software developers make the most out of evaluations of their
    software.

- abstract: "Objective Nowadays we are facing a raising in adverse
    events related to robotic procedures due to lacking well-trained
    robotic surgeons. To cope with this issue, along with a standardized
    surgical training program, the advent of new technologies can come
    handy in helping beginner surgeons to avoid unwanted surgical
    events. In this study, a model based on Artificial Intelligence (AI)
    was developed to predict the occurrence of intraoperative bleeding
    and to warn the surgeon on bleeding risk. Patients and surgical
    procedure A dedicated artificial Neural Network (NN) was created and
    trained to recognize active bleeding during robot-assisted radical
    prostatectomy (RARP). The created software scans the video recorded
    by the endoscope every 3 seconds, and returns the confidence rating,
    in percentage, that the bleeding event is recognized in that
    interval of time. Confident rates lower than 100% were used as a
    score to predict the possibility of the bleeding occurrence in the
    next frames, alerting the medical staff beforehand. All the videos
    recorded were reviewed by a human operator in order to evaluate the
    capability of the software to correctly identify the bleeding and
    the performances were analyzed in terms of true/false
    negative/positive. Results 10 patients undergoing RARP were enrolled
    from October 2021 to April 2022. Our software demonstrated: (1)
    Correct identification of active bleeding (true positive 98%); (2)
    no false alert in case of absence of bleeding (false positive 3%);
    (3) Ability to anticipate, by gradually increasing the %, the
    possible occurrence of the event; (4) Beyond the 93-95% threshold,
    the event occurs in the next second. Conclusion Our software, based
    on NN, reveales to be able to predict the intraoperative bleeding.
    The prediction of adverse events during robotic surgery with
    Artificial Intelligence will help the beginner surgeons during
    interventions, potentially improving patient's safety."

- abstract: "Background: The da Vinci Surgical System has led to a rapid
    growth in the volume of robot-assisted surgeries, with 877,000
    surgeries performed in 2017. Despite the increasing prevalence of
    robotic urologic surgeries, few long-term studies exist that examine
    trends in reported adverse events (RAEs). We analyzed RAEs over the
    past decade. Materials and Methods: We extrapolated all entries from
    the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE)
    database with the manufacturer \"Intuitive Surgical\" from 2007 to
    2017. Reports were analyzed for date and type of RAE (death, bodily
    injury, malfunction, and other). RAEs from urologic surgeries were
    analyzed further for specific information pertaining to death,
    bodily injury, and malfunction. Results: A total of 19,783 RAEs were
    analyzed. Instrument or robot malfunctions comprised the majority of
    RAEs (84.9%); bodily injuries comprised 8.2%. Death was the least
    common RAE (1.3%). RAEs for urologic robotic surgeries peaked in
    2013 and 2014 and decreased since. A total of 69 (2.3%) deaths, 364
    (12.2%) injuries, and 2544 (85.5%) instrument or robot malfunctions
    occurred. No reported deaths were attributed to system or mechanical
    malfunction, but rather to medical complications reported to be
    unrelated to surgery. The most common injuries were bowel (22.3%)
    and genitourinary (GU) (19.5%). Instrument malfunctions caused 16.8%
    of bodily injuries. Conclusions: RAEs for robotic urologic surgeries
    peaked in 2013 to 2014, and have decreased annually since. When
    malfunctions occurred, they did not result in death and infrequently
    resulted in bodily injury. Potential quality improvement targets
    include prevention of bowel and GU injuries through surgical
    coaching, and improved technology to prevent malfunction of the
    surgical system and instruments."

    machine produced by Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL) in 1982
    after the Therac-6 and Therac-20 units (the earlier units had been
    produced in partnership with Compagnie gÃ©nÃ©rale de radiologie (CGR)
    of France). It was involved in at least six accidents between 1985
    and 1987, in which patients were given massive overdoses of
    radiation.: 425 Because of concurrent programming errors (also known
    as race conditions), it sometimes gave its patients radiation doses
    that were hundreds of times greater than normal, resulting in death
    or serious injury. These accidents highlighted the dangers of
    software control of safety-critical systems, and they have become a
    standard case study in health informatics, software engineering, and
    computer ethics. Additionally, the overconfidence of the engineers:
    428 and lack of proper due diligence to resolve reported software
    bugs are highlighted as an extreme case where the engineers'
    overconfidence in their initial work and failure to believe the end
    users' claims caused drastic repercussions."

- abstract: The Sepsis Prediction Model (SPM) is a proprietary decision
    support tool created by Epic Systems; it generates a predicting
    sepsis score (PSS). The model has not undergone validation against
    existing sepsis prediction tools, such as Systemic Inflammatory
    Response Syndrome (SIRS), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment
    (SOFA), or quick Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Asessement (qSOFA).To
    assess the validity and timeliness of the SPM compared with SIRS,
    qSOFA, and SOFA.This retrospective cohort study included all adults
    admitted to 5 acute care hospitals in a single US health system
    between June 5, 2019, and December 31, 2020. Data analysis was
    conducted from March 2021 to February 2023.A sepsis event was
    defined as receipt of 4 or more days of antimicrobials, blood
    cultures collected within Â±48 hours of initial antimicrobial, and at
    least 1 organ dysfunction as defined by the organ dysfunction
    criteria optimized for the electronic health record (eSOFA). Time
    zero was defined as 15 minutes prior to qualifying antimicrobial or
    blood culture order.Of 60 507 total admissions, 1663 (2.7%) met
    sepsis criteria, with 1324 electronic health record--confirmed
    sepsis (699 \[52.8%\] male patients; 298 \[22.5%\] Black patients;
    46 \[3.5%\] Hispanic/Latinx patients; 945 \[71.4%\] White patients),
    339 COVID-19 sepsis (183 \[54.0%\] male patients; 98 \[28.9%\] Black
    patients; 36 \[10.6%\] Hispanic/Latinx patients; and 189 \[55.8%\]
    White patients), and 58 844 (97.3%; 26 632 \[45.2%\] male patients;
    12 698 \[21.6%\] Black patients; 3367 \[5.7%\] Hispanic/Latinx
    patients; 40 491 White patients) did not meet sepsis criteria. The
    median (IQR) age was 63 (51 to 73) years for electronic health
    record--confirmed sepsis, 69 (60 to 77) years for COVID-19 sepsis,
    and 60 (42 to 72) years for nonsepsis admissions. Within the vendor
    recommended threshold PSS range of 5 to 8, PSS of 8 or greater had
    the highest balanced accuracy for classifying a sepsis admission at
    0.79 (95% CI, 0.78 to 0.80). Change in SOFA score of 2 or more had
    the highest sensitivity, at 0.97 (95% CI, 0.97 to 0.98). At a PSS of
    8 or greater, median (IQR) time to score positivity from time zero
    was 68.00 (6.75 to 605.75) minutes. For SIRS, qSOFA, and SOFA,
    median (IQR) time to score positivity was 7.00 (â105.00 to 08.00)
    minutes, 74.00 (â22.25 to 599.25) minutes, and 28.00 (â108.50 to
    134.00) minutes, respectively.In this cohort study of hospital
    admissions, balanced accuracy of the SPM outperformed other models
    at higher threshold PSS; however, application of the SPM in a
    clinical setting was limited by poor timeliness as a sepsis
    screening tool as compared to SIRS and SOFA.

- abstract: "Introduction Robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery (RALS) has
    become a widely used technology in urology. Urological procedures
    that are now being routinely performed robotically are: radical
    prostatectomy (RP), radical cystectomy (RC), renal procedures --
    mainly partial nephrectomy (PN), and pyeloplasty, as well as
    ureteric re-implantation and adrenalectomy. Methods This
    non-systematic review of the literature examines the effectiveness
    of RALS compared with conventional laparoscopic surgery for the most
    relevant urological procedures. Results For robot-assisted RP there
    seems to be an advantage in terms of continence and potency over
    laparoscopy. Robot-assisted RC seems equal in terms of oncological
    outcome but with lower complication rates; however, the effect of
    intracorporeal urinary diversion has hardly been examined. Robotic
    PN has proven safe and is most likely superior to conventional
    laparoscopy, whereas there does not seem to be a real advantage for
    the robot in radical nephrectomy. For reconstructive procedures,
    e.g. pyeloplasty and ureteric re-implantation, there seems to be
    advantages in terms of operating time. Conclusions We found
    substantial, albeit mostly low-quality evidence, that robotic
    operations can have better outcomes than procedures performed
    laparoscopically. However, in light of the significant costs and
    because high-quality data from prospective randomised trials are
    still missing, conventional urological laparoscopy is certainly not
    'dead' yet."

- abstract: "Background The integration of high technology into health
    care systems is intended to provide new treatment options and
    improve the quality, safety, and efficiency of care.
    Robotic-assisted surgery is an example of high technology
    integration in health care, which has become ubiquitous in many
    surgical disciplines. Objective This study aims to understand and
    measure current robotic-assisted surgery processes in a systematic,
    quantitative, and replicable manner to identify latent systemic
    threats and opportunities for improvement based on our observations
    and to implement and evaluate interventions. This 5-year study will
    follow a human factors engineering approach to improve the safety
    and efficiency of robotic-assisted surgery across 4 US hospitals.
    Methods The study uses a stepped wedge crossover design with 3
    interventions, introduced in different sequences at each of the
    hospitals over four 8-month phases. Robotic-assisted surgery
    procedures will be observed in the following specialties:
    urogynecology, gynecology, urology, bariatrics, general, and
    colorectal. We will use the data collected from observations,
    surveys, and interviews to inform interventions focused on teamwork,
    task design, and workplace design. We intend to evaluate attitudes
    toward each intervention, safety culture, subjective workload for
    each case, effectiveness of each intervention (including through
    direct observation of a sample of surgeries in each observational
    phase), operating room duration, length of stay, and patient safety
    incident reports. Analytic methods will include statistical data
    analysis, point process analysis, and thematic content analysis.
    Results The study was funded in September 2018 and approved by the
    institutional review board of each institution in May and June of
    2019 (CSMC and MDRH: Pro00056245; VCMC: STUDY 270; MUSC:
    Pro00088741). After refining the 3 interventions in phase 1, data
    collection for phase 2 (baseline data) began in November 2019 and
    was scheduled to continue through June 2020. However, data
    collection was suspended in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
    We collected a total of 65 observations across the 4 sites before
    the pandemic. Data collection for phase 2 was resumed in October
    2020 at 2 of the 4 sites. Conclusions This will be the largest
    direct observational study of surgery ever conducted with data
    collected on 680 robotic surgery procedures at 4 different
    institutions. The proposed interventions will be evaluated using
    individual-level (workload and attitude), process-level
    (perioperative duration and flow disruption), and
    organizational-level (safety culture and complications) measures. An
    implementation science framework is also used to investigate the
    causes of success or failure of each intervention at each site and
    understand the potential spread of the interventions. International

    Laparoscopic Surgery

- abstract: "Objective To compare different techniques of minimally
    invasive surgery (laparoscopy and robotics) to abdominal surgery in
    order to identify the optimal surgical technique in the treatment of
    endometrial cancer. Methods and materials A single-institutional,
    matched, retrospective, cohort study was performed. All patients
    with clinical stage I or occult stage II endometrial cancer who
    underwent robotic hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy Â±
    lymphadenectomy from August 2010 and December 2013 were identified.
    Surgical and oncological outcomes were compared with patients
    matched by age, body mass index, tumor histology, and grade, who
    underwent abdominal or laparoscopic surgery between January 2001 and
    December 2013. Results Three groups were identified: 177
    laparotomies (group A), 277 laparoscopies (group B) and 72 robotics
    (group C). There were no statistically significant differences
    between the three groups in terms of age, BMI and FIGO stage. The
    operative time was shortest in group B (p = 0.0001). Blood loss and
    transfusions were equivalent in group B and C, while they were
    greater in group A (p = 0.0001). The intra-operative, early and late
    postoperative complications, rate of conversion, the re-intervention
    and median hospital stay were lower in group C. The rate of
    recurrence and death from disease was similar in all three groups.
    Conclusions Minimally invasive surgery was superior to abdominal
    surgery in terms of surgical outcomes. Robotic surgery was superior
    to laparoscopy in terms of intra- and post-operative complications,
    conversion rates, length of hospital stay and re-interventions. In
    terms of oncological outcomes the three groups were equivalent."
