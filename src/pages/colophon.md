# Colophon

I made this page using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/)! I don't think this is a typical, or intended use of docusaurus, but
it is a super cool static site generator I wanted to experiment with. While this is a new technology to me, and a decently complicated one,
I thoroughly enjoyed creating a basic site. I would love to experiment further with Docusaurus to make my page more creative. This project is hosted through GitHub pages (I have a custom domain). [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) helped me generate a hopefully beautiful colorway.
